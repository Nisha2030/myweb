<h1>About Nature</h1>
<p>
Nature is an inherent character or constitution,particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole. 
In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world, including life. 
Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature. 
During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, 
organized and moved by divine laws.With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the 
part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions 
(Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). 
However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially 
after Charles Darwin.
Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to 
the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate 
objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and 
geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, 
forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which 
persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not 
considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more 
traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human 
consciousness or a human mind. Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural.

<h2>About Internet</h2>
<p>
The Internet (or internet) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.

The origins of the Internet date back to research to enable time-sharing of computer resources and the development of packet switching in the 1960s. The set of rules (communication protocols) to enable internetworking on the Internet arose from research and development commissioned in the 1970s by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the United States Department of Defense in collaboration with universities and researchers across the United States and in the United Kingdom and France. The ARPANET initially served as a backbone for the interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the United States to enable resource sharing. The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, encouraged worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies and the merger of many networks using DARPA's Internet protocol suite. The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s, as well as the advent of the World Wide Web, marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet, and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s, the subsequent commercialization in the 1990s and beyond incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.

<h3>About Html 5</h3>
<p>
HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language 5) is a markup language used for structuring and presenting hypertext documents on the World Wide Web. It was the fifth and final major HTML version that is now a retired World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).

HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc.

HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves, and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications. For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.
