<h2 class="about">Luxury Trains</h2>
Luxury trains in India date back to its colonial era, when opulent carriages transported dignitaries, officials and royalty.

More trains were built in the 19th century for the country’s maharajas and other ruling elites and their families.

Following India’s independence in 1947, privy purses — or governmental payments to these rulers — ended. Without the money to maintain them, India’s luxury rail carriages were abandoned.
<br/>
Indian Railways, which is part of India’s national railway system, refurbished several trains over the years, with the first making its debut in the 1980s. The trains were introduced to promote tourism in India by providing travelers with a unique and opulent way to experience the country.

Blending historical elegance with modern comforts, these trains are a glimpse into India’s regal past.

A note to travelers: Travel companies have websites that appear to be official sites for the trains in this article, sometimes selling trips at higher rates. Official sites for each train are embedded in the links.

				<li><font size="4" color="#006600"><b>A Food Lover's Guide to Indian Cuisine:</b></font></li><br/>
				<li>ndian cuisine may be said to be an art, an array of colored pots filled with mouthwatering dishes that could each retell a history of India. The food ranges from the exotic mountain fare of the himalayas to the exotic sea food of the coconuts of kerala and thus having an array of taste buds that savor the tongue and mind.

In this all-India guide, we will go on the regional trip and discover the main dishes and the component that make Indian cuisine exceptional.
<br/><br/>
<font color="#006600"><b>Introduction: The Essence of Indian Cuisine</b></font>
<br/><br/>
The Indian food is well known for its spicy and aromatic qualities as Indian spices form the major part of food preparation. One thing that is unique to Indian cuisine is the use of spice like cumin, corriander, turmeric and garam masala to offer a fragrance and flavor to the food.

Apart from the spices, Indian cuisine is also defined by the manner of preparing foods through methods such as roasting, grilling, sautéing, and steaming. Coupled with assorted climate and geographical conditions, these techniques have produced a wide spread of regional specialties that are distinguished by their individuality.

<br/>
The province of Punjab is known as ‘The Land of Five Rivers’ and its food is rich, dense, and heavy on spices. Here, I have noted that most of the food is spicy, liberally supplemented with ghee and cream in some meals making the food delicious and creamy.

Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhani): This delicious chicken contains chicken pieces prepared in a tomato-based gravy that is further thickened with butter and cream.

<br/>
The food of Rajasthan is spicy, dry and has been greatly influenced by the royal rule of the state. It lacks fresh vegetables, fruits and fancy items as most of the foods that are prepared are spicy and are prepared with food items that do not perish easily like lentils, beans and millets.
